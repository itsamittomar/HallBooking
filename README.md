### About

The project is a Rest API application with **6** seminar halls - 

| Hall Name | Capacity |
| --------- | -------- |
| A         | 50       |
| B         | 100      |
| C         | 200      |

| F         | 1000     |

A starter code of the application is provided for you. The application is built using **python** and **flask**. Don't worry if you have not worked with **flask**, you just have to complete a function using **core python**.

### Installation and Running

1. Install the packages in file `requirements.txt`. **You must create a virtual environment and setup the packages**.
2. Run `start.py` to start the application.
3. Run `test/test_api.py` to check if application is started properly. It will return some sample bookings.
